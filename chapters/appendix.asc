Appendix
--------

(TODO) Write an appendix serves both the reader and the writer of a research paper. In the appendix, writers can include material that supports their theses but that would be distracting in the text of a given paper. Such material might include detailed descriptions of equipment, relevant mathematical proofs, research questionnaires or a detailed description of a cited author's intent. If you find yourself going off on a tangent in your paper, but you also feel that the discussion is relevant and helpful to the reader, it may belong in an appendix.
